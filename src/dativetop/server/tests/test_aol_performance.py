"""AOL Performance Tests

These aren't really tests. They are timings of basic AOL operations related to
persistence and file I/O.

Key Take-aways:

1. Since we are primarily adding to the ends of Python lists and appending to
   text files, all basic operations are in O(1).

2. The AOL persistence files can become quite large. An AOL of 80,000 lines is
   13M, one of 800,000 lines is 130M. The former takes 0.4 seconds to load into
   memory, the latter takes 4.8s. As an AOL grows, it should be persisted
   across multiple files.

3. Related to (2), reads from large AOLs should be implemented using multiple
   processes, each responsible for a portion of the AOL.

Detailed Q&As:

- Question: How long does it take to create a large AOL (list of Appendables) in
  memory?

  - Answer: Constant time, regardless of size of AOL. It takes about 0.00002
    seconds to generate a single appendable and append it to an AOL. In the
    following, we have (1) number of OLDInstances in AOL, (2) number of quads
    (entries) in AOL, (3) total time, and (4) time per append:

        >>> [(1, 8, 0.00017189979553222656, 2.148747444152832e-05),
        ...  (1000000, 8000000, 178.8148159980774, 2.2351851999759674e-05)]

- Question: How long does it take to write a large AOL file to disk?

  - Answer: Constant time, regardless of size of AOL. It takes 5e-06 seconds
    per appendable to write an AOL to disk:

        >>> [AOLPersist(entity_count=1, write_time=0.0002300739288330078, file_size=1358),
        ...  AOLPersist(entity_count=100000, write_time=4.107442140579224, file_size=135799993)]
        ...  AOLPersist(entity_count=1000000, write_time=40.92316484451294, file_size=1357999958)]

- Question: How long does it take to read a large AOL file from disk?

  - Answer: Apparently constant time. It takes 6e-06 seconds per appendable to
    read a large AOL from disk.

        >>> [('aol-size-10000.txt', 0.4077169895172119),   # 5.09e-06
        ...  ('aol-size-100000.txt', 4.75993800163269),    # 5.94e-06
        ...  ('aol-size-1000000.txt', 52.32560205459595)]  # 6.54e-06

- Question: How long does it take to append to a large AOL file on disk?

  - Answer: Constant time. It takes about 1.25e-05 seconds to append an
    appendable to an AOL, regardless of the size of the AOL. In the following,
    the times are for appending 8 appendables::

        >>> [('aol-size-1.txt', 0.00011014938354492188),
        ...  ('aol-size-10000.txt', 0.00010776519775390625),
        ...  ('aol-size-100000.txt', 0.0001049041748046875),
        ...  ('aol-size-1000000.txt', 0.000141143798828125)]
